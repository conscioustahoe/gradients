By the end of the process (at time step $T$), the data should resemble pure noise, typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$.\n",

    "At each step $t$, a small amount of Gaussian noise is added to the previous state $\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}$. This noise is parameterized by $\\beta_t$, which controls how much noise is injected at each step.

    "Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **KL divergence at each step $ t $**: For each time step $ t $, we compute the KL divergence between the true reverse process $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $ and the learned reverse process $ p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t) $. This ensures the model learns a good approximation of the reverse process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reconstruction at $ t = 1 $**: At the last time step of the reverse process, $ p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_0 | \\mathbf{x}_1) $ (pronounced **\"p theta of x naught given x sub 1\"**) measures how well the model can reconstruct the original data $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $ from the slightly noisy $ \\mathbf{x}_1 $. This term is typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Simplifying the Training Loss (Connecting to the MSE Loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the **ELBO** provides a complete theoretical framework, in practice, the training loss in DDPMs is often simplified to the **mean squared error (MSE)** between the true noise $ \\epsilon_t $ and the noise predicted by the model $ \\epsilon_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_t, t) $, as we saw earlier:\n",

    "The distribution $q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0)$ (pronounced: **\"q of x sub t minus 1 given x sub t and x naught\"**) represents the **true reverse process** that describes how we can move from noisy data $ \\mathbf{x}_t $ (at time step $ t $) to less noisy data $ \\mathbf{x}_{t-1} $ (at time step $ t-1 $).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why is $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $ intractable?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $ is intractable, let's break it down into two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (a) Complexity of the Conditionals\n",
    "$q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0)$ involves **two unknowns** — both $ \\mathbf{x}_t $ (the noisy data) and $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $ (the original data). Computing this conditional distribution exactly would require us to model the complex joint distribution of $ \\mathbf{x}_t $ and $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $ across all time steps of the forward process. This involves high-dimensional integrations over the latent variables, which are extremely difficult to compute analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the forward process, $ \\mathbf{x}_t $ is generated through a sequence of noisy transformations starting from $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q(\\mathbf{x}_t | \\mathbf{x}_0) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\mathbf{x}_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t) \\mathbf{I})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the true reverse process $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $, we would need to account for **all the possible ways** that noise could have been added at each prior step in the forward process to create $ \\mathbf{x}_t $. This requires solving a complex probabilistic relationship involving **many interacting variables**, which is computationally intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (b) Marginalization Over $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $\n",
    "Another challenge is that the true reverse process depends on the original clean data $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $, which we don’t have access to during the reverse process. This means that we need to **marginalize over $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $** (integrate out $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $) in order to compute $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true reverse distribution is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t) = \\int q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) p(\\mathbf{x}_0 | \\mathbf{x}_t) \\, d\\mathbf{x}_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we need to compute the probability of $ \\mathbf{x}_{t-1} $ given $ \\mathbf{x}_t $, by averaging over all possible values of $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $. But marginalizing over $ \\mathbf{x}_0 $ (the clean data) is a high-dimensional integration problem that we cannot solve analytically in closed form, especially for large and complex datasets like images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Can't We Approximate $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $ with Simple Distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The true reverse process $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $ is a complex distribution because it describes how to **denoise the data** at each time step in a way that depends on the entire history of noise added up to that point. This complexity comes from the fact that:\n",
    "- The noise is added in small, incremental steps, and how the noise \"should be removed\" at step $ t $ depends on all prior steps.\n",
    "- The forward process involves adding noise in a probabilistic, stochastic way, which makes it difficult to write down an exact form for how to reverse this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we tried to approximate the true reverse process using simple distributions, we would miss these dependencies, and the reverse process would become inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Do We Use $ p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t) $ Instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $ is intractable, we instead **learn an approximation** using a neural network. This gives us the **learned reverse distribution** $ p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t) $ (pronounced **\"p theta of x sub t minus 1 given x sub t\"**), which is modeled as a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learned reverse process $ p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t) $ is parameterized by the neural network $ \\epsilon_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_t, t) $ (which predicts the noise), and is trained to approximate the true reverse process by minimizing the KL divergence between $ q(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t, \\mathbf{x}_0) $ and $ p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} | \\mathbf{x}_t) $."
